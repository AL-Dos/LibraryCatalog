# Library Catalog
This full-stack web application allows users to borrow and return books from a library through an online website, making it easier to track them. Admins of the website can track the user who borrowed/returned books and flag a user for an overdue book that has yet to be replaced or a book that has been damaged. Flagging a user means they have to pay a fine for the damages or being overdue.

## Features
1. **Admin & User accounts**
> To access the library catalog, we need accounts to verify which person can access executive privileges.
2. **Inventory of books**
> So admins and users can see which book is borrowed or available in the system.
3. **User flagging**
> An executive privilege that admins can use to penalize users who violate the rules when returning a book (e.g., returned as damaged, overdue, lost, etc.)
4. **Borrowing and Returning**
> A UI where a person can confirm the borrowed or returned books.
5. **Cart**
> A cart where you can store books if you have several of them you want to borrow.
6. **Book Track**
> An executive privilege that admins can use to see the users who borrowed a specific book/s.

## Benefits
1. **General Use**
> The public library or school-owned library can use the system.
2. **Faster process**
> Borrowing a book will be like a shopping app where you can browse and add it to the list you want to borrow in your cart.
3. **Easier tracking**
> Admins can easily track who borrowed the books by looking at the system.
4. **Quick Access**
> People can view the available books in the library very quickly by accessing the inventory of the system.
